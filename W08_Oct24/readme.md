<h1>WEEK 8 | Oct 24 </h1>
<p><strong>MIDTERM PRESENTATIONS</strong><br>
If presentations were not finished in the previous class, we will continue them during this class.</p>
<p><strong>WORKSHOP</strong><br>
The rest of the class will be spent working on individual projects, specifically homepage.html. We will be:<br>
- Applying styles proposed during midterm presentations (buttons and links, typography, images)<br>
- Building out coherent global navs & footers (working and styled)<br>
- Troubleshooting layouts (valid code, everything aligns, troubleshooting in general)
</p>
<p>GITHUB PRESENTATIONS><br>
- Sign up sheet: sign up by next class, otherwise I will assign times<br>
- Short, informal presentations about how your final projects are going. So <b>the purpose of this presentation</b> is to show your progress and talk to your peers about how you have been handling learning code. You could among many other things:<br>
- Walk us through your github and explain your process<br>
- Show different versions of your work and talk about how you pushed through from one version to another<br>
- Look at specific code or modules<br>
- Do an interpretive dance</p>
