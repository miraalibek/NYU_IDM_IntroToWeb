<p><strong>Design inspiration: some thought starters + moodboards</strong><br>
<a href="IntrotoWeb_W2_DesignInspiration.pdf">Here</a> is some info from me about my own visual inspirations. <br> We will also talk about starting to work towards your moodboards/design concepts</p>

<p><strong>Why we are using github</strong><br>
So having a github repository is a must for this class... <i>Why?</i> <br>
Because we are using it like a learning diary - learning log. <br>
<i>This is a big part of your grade (part of homework and participation)</i><br><br>
<b>Starting Oct 10, there will be short presentation of your learning log. </b><br>
Need to: <br>
- Show and tell about what you are learning<br>
- What you found difficult/easy/exciting/need to work on.<br>
- How are you progressing in figuring out your final project.</p>

<p><strong>Organizing content</strong><br>
UX basics, deliverables, concepts, UI patterns, CTAs<br>
<a href="IntrotoWeb_W2_OrganizingContent.pdf">Slide pdf</a> has some references and links you might need.</p>

<p><strong>Starting to look at how to organize a page with code</strong><br>- list of layout strategies:  <a href="IntrotoWeb_W2b_LayoutStrategies.pdf">slide.pdf</a><br>
- Simple tables. Check out  <a href="https://github.com/miraalibek/NYU_IDM_IntroToWeb/tree/master/W2_Sept10/tables">the html files</a></p>

<p><b>HOMEWORK:</b><br>
- Install Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator: <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-started/students.html">more about how to get it as NYU student</a><br>
- If you have a mac, please install trial version of Sketch (good for 30 days). You can download a free trial <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">here</a>. <i>Note: this is just so you can follow in class with Sketch files. Will not be necessary for homework... Adobe will be though!</i> <br>
- Bring paper + pencil to next class: we'll go analog with some wireframing sketches<br>
- If we didn't get a chance to look at <b>tables</b>, do that on your own time!
