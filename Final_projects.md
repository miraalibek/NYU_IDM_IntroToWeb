<h1>Final Projects</h1>
Final projects are due <b>BEFORE Dec 10th class</b> and presentations will start Dec 10th and go through Dec 12th (our last class).<br><br>

The final project is about producing a website with solid code and coherent styles <br>
<em>(meaning not judging on how pretty your site is...although "pretty" is nice and will be taken into considerations, but CODE and CONSISTENCY)</em>

<p>
<em>FORMAT <br></em>
- .html documents with properly linked .css and .js documents <br>
- number of pages is dependent on your proposal/type of project. If multipage website, need at least 3 working pages (at the very minimum) including. If building one long-scroll page, must be working! <br>
- Homepage must be complete. <br><br>

<em>DESIGN <br></em>
- In terms of design criteria, make sure your styles are consistent (buttons, typography and layout make general sense) <br><br>

<em>CODE <br></em>
Valid code and coding requirements will be the main criteria for judging the success of the final project. <BR><BR>
- Validated code (No syntax mistakes please!)<br>
- Must use float or flex in the layout (not necessarily a grid system, although that would be great). can use css grid module, if prefer that to float or flex. <br>
- Working global navigation (styled, clickable, etc)<br>
- Non-system font (google or webfonts) must be used in one of the type styles<br>
- Working links & buttons (hovers working, if linking to other pages on site)<br>
- Include extensive CSS and some JS functionality. <br>
