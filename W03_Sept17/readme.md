<p><b>W3 Validation for CSS</b><br>
W3C validation package for atom should already take care of catching CSS mistakes, but just in case you can always go : <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload">here</a></p>

What are <b>block and inline elements?</b> and why is that important. So talking about {display: block;} & {display:inline} <br><br>

<b>CSS Box Model</b>: a simple concept, but important to keep in mind, as we go into working with div elements.  <a href= "IntrotoWeb_W2_CSSBoxModel.pdf">slides here</a><br><br>

We are also going to look at how to block out with div elements: basically sketching out a page.</p>





<p><b>Any questions about homework? </b><br>
You were supposed to sketch out a sitemap and a homepage wireframe. This was a practice exercise to see how you can start organizing your website. You can definitely change/iterate on this first sketch as you progress.</p>
