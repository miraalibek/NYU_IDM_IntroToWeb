<h1>WEEK 5 | Oct 3 </h1>
<p><strong>Mood-boards: informal presentations / class working session</strong><br>
We'll spend the first part of the class talking checking out your moodboards and discussing them as a class. These are informal sessions to get our creative juices flowing:)
</p>
<p><strong>Flexbox grid:</strong><br>
We can use flexbox grid to build out complex page layouts. We are back to our simple colored boxes, looking at a simplified bootstrap grid. <a href="https://github.com/miraalibek/NYU_IDM_IntroToWeb/tree/master/W5_Oct3/flex_grid"> Files here</a></p>
<p><strong>Looking at Bootstrap </strong><br>
These are <a href="https://github.com/miraalibek/NYU_IDM_IntroToWeb/tree/master/W5_Oct3/bootstrap-4.3.1-dist">bootstrap files</a> to check out. You can also download them on <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">boostrap site</a></p>
<p><strong>Forms </strong><br>
We'll look at a way to style <a href="https://github.com/miraalibek/NYU_IDM_IntroToWeb/tree/master/W5_Oct3/form">a simple form</a>. You can't really make forms work without some knowledge of databases, but we'll look into the frontend design and build.
