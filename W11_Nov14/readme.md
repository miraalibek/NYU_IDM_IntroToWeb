<h1>WEEK 11 | Nov 14 </h1>
<h3><b>JS Practice</b></h3>
<p><b>Learning Process Presentations:</b><br>
Zheng, Alejandra & Cesar</p>

<p><b>Final project & Final grade</b><br>
Final presentations will start Dec 10th, so the final projects will have to be turned in <em>BEFORE class Dec 10th</em>. <a href="../Final_projects.md">Here</a> are the requirements/expectations.

</p>

<p><b>Github/code check-in:</b> post your work on github this weekend. I will start looking in on it on Monday to make sure that you are on track for final projects. WILL BE GRADED (BUT NOT ON VALIDITY OF CODE, ON EFFORT)</p>

<p><b>Code Examples</b><br>
<em>Mailchimp contact form:</em><br>
Already talked about it, but here is <a href="contact_form">the file</a> just in case.</p>
<p>
<b>A bunch of JS examples</b><br>
<a href="contact_form">This file</a> has a bunch of examples to check out, and we go over some of them and do a bit of coding:<br><br>
HERO/IMAGE CAROUSEL: related to our card carousel, but contains images & much simpler. Look at hero_carousel.js and hero_carousel.css files.<br><br>
STICKY NAV: This is global navigation that toggles between full/expanded view and abbreviated view on scroll. Look at sticky_nav.js and sticky_nav.css files.<br><br>

CLICKABLE IMAGE/MOUSE COORDINATES: This shows how you can track the user's mouse over an image. There is also a connected image following a cursor. This could be used instead of image maps, gives you more control over what you want to do with the image. Look at click_image.js and click_image.css files.<br><br>

GOOGLE SEARCH: So to do a proper search bar you need to be searching a database (involves php) or using 3rd party search engines (Google, Bing etc). Inside the page there is an embedded google search bar with some information on how to add it. Look inside the html page itself and the basic.css.<br><br>

PRELOADER: This shows how to have a preload screen. There is a version with timeout interval inside the main file (bunchExamples.html). Remember that if you do not have a very KB heavy page, you have to SetInterval, so the user can actually see your preload screen. The code for that is in the preloader.css and preloader.js<br><br>

PRELOADER THAT ACTUALLY CHECKS FOR PAGE LOAD TIME: So this preloading script is actually checking for approximate loading time of your page.  You will only need it, if you are loading A LOT of HEAVY media.  The script in this page (<a href="bunch_of_examples/percentage_loader.html">percentage_loader.html</a>) is not finished, but gives you an idea of what needs to be done. Math for percentage calculations isn't finished here. <br>
<em>NOTE: images shown in class not included, cause too heavy for Github</em><br><br>
